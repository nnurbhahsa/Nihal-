            <p class="intro">The satisfaction I receive from solving complex problems and observing the solutions live time 
                is incalculable.</p>

            <p>I will be graduating from the Engineering Flex program for fullstack-developers in March 2020. 
                It is a coding bootcamp run by Thinkful, in conjunction with the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. 
                I also graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a Bachelors of Arts in 
                International Relations, Global Security (Spanish Concentration) and a certificate in 
                Computer Science in the May of 2019.</p>

            <p>I hope to utilize the skills I have learned thus far to assist others in bringing about 
                positive changes on a macro scale. Avenues for this goal include, but are not limited to, 
                the enviornment, health and finances.</p>
                
            <p>Outside of my professional life, I enjoy pursuing a fit lifestyle, listening to books and 
                cheffing up delicious meals for my loved ones. I am also intensely passionate about chess. 
                Wish me luck for my upcoming tournament!</p>
